  <p style="color:rgb(255, 8, 0);"> <b> Travelling is my passion or hobby whatever you say, but I just love to travel.<br>
                          It is my dream to travel the whole world and explore the beautiful places.<br>
                           From mountains with full of greenery to sea with endless shore,the mother earth is so beautiful.<br>
                           It is amazing to witness the rare and diversified nature with your own eyes.<br>
                           A trip can also help one person to know his real self. If you observe the trees,the standstill mountains <br>
                          , the roaring sea, you will get to learn so many things.<br>
                           Talking about my trips, I visited Assam,Puri,Jammu&Kashmir,Rajasthan and North Bengal with my family.<br>
                           I thoroughly enjoyed each one of the trip.All this trips gave me a beauiful memory as well as some good lessons.<br>
                           To be specific,I am very much fond of trains so i prefer and love travelling by train only.I am lucky enough that my father<br>
                           accomodated us in Rajdhani express,that journey was something i will remember for the rest of my life.<br>
